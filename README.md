# Employee Management System
## Overview

The Employee Management System is a web-based application designed to manage employee records efficiently. The system supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing administrators to add new employees, view employee details, update their information, and delete records as needed. The application provides a light-themed, user-friendly interface with easy-to-navigate features.
### Features

    Create: Add new employee records including name, department, position, and contact details.
    Read: View a list of all employees or check detailed information for a specific employee.
    Update: Modify existing employee information to keep the records up-to-date.
    Delete: Remove an employee from the system when necessary.

### Technologies Used

    Frontend: HTML, CSS (custom styles), JavaScript
    Backend: Node.js with Express (or any other framework you used)
    Database: JSON, in-memory storage, or a relational database like MySQL (replace with your actual setup)
    Version Control: Git

### Installation

To set up the Employee Management System locally, follow the instructions below.
### Prerequisites

    Node.js (for the backend)
    npm (Node Package Manager)
    [Database] (If you're using a specific database like MySQL, ensure it is installed and running)

### Setup Instructions

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/chetan9129/ems_panel.git

### Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash

cd employee-management-system

### Install Dependencies:

For the backend:

bash

cd backend
npm install

### Configure the Database (If using a database):

    If you are using a database, configure your database settings in the server.js file or the .env file.
    If using a JSON or in-memory database, you can skip this step.

### Run the Backend:

bash

    npm start

    This will start the backend server on http://localhost:3001 (or your specified port).

    Run the Frontend:
        Open the index.html file in the frontend folder in a web browser.
        Alternatively, serve the frontend using a live server or another local server.

### Accessing the Application

    Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your configuration).

    You can now create, view, update, and delete employee records using the user-friendly interface.
